# Project README.md

## Project Overview

This project is part of a curriculum focusing on Python and backend development. It involves various tasks aimed at improving your understanding and skills in Python programming, specifically in the context of variable annotations.

## Concepts Covered

- Advanced Python
- Type annotations in Python 3
- Using type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- Validating code with mypy

## Resources

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

- Explain type annotations in Python 3
- Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understand duck typing
- Validate code with mypy

## Requirements

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Platform:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Python version:** 3.7
- **File endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **Shebang line:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- **README.md:** A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- **Code style:** Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- **Executable files:** All your files must be executable
- **File length:** The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- **Documentation:** All your modules, classes, and functions should have documentation explaining their purpose
- **Variable definitions:** Define and annotate specific variables with the specified values

## Tasks

1. **Basic annotations - add**
   - Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

2. **Basic annotations - concat**
   - Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two string arguments and returns their concatenation as a string.

3. **Basic annotations - floor**
   - Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float argument and returns its floor as an int.

4. **Basic annotations - to string**
   - Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float argument and returns its string representation.

5. **Define variables**
   - Define and annotate specific variables with the specified values.

6. **Complex types - list of floats**
   - Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` that takes a list of floats and returns their sum as a float.

7. **Complex types - mixed list**
   - Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

8. **Complex types - string and int/float to tuple**
   - Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string and an int or float and returns a tuple.

9. **Complex types - functions**
   - Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float and returns a function that multiplies a float by the given float.

10. **Let's duck type an iterable object**
    - Annotate a function `element_length` that takes an iterable object and returns a list of tuples with each tuple containing an element from the iterable and its length.
